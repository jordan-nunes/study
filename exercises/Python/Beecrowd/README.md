# 🐝 Beecrowd

This directory contains my solutions to various programming challenges from [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/), a competitive programming platform. These exercises are solved in Python and aim to improve my problem-solving skills, algorithm design, and coding efficiency.  

## 🗂️ Structure  

The exercises are organized by their unique problem IDs, making it easy to locate specific challenges and solutions.  

### Example Structure  

```plaintext  
Beecrowd/  
│  
├── 1001.py  # Solution to problem ID 1001  
├── 1002.py  # Solution to problem ID 1002  
├── 1003.py  # Solution to problem ID 1003  
└── ...  
```  

## 📄 Contents  

- **Problem Statements**: Each file corresponds to a problem ID on Beecrowd. Refer to the platform for the full problem description.  
- **Solutions**: Each file contains a Python implementation of the solution, with comments explaining the logic and approach.  

## 🚀 How to Use  

1. **Locate the Problem**: Find the file matching the problem ID you’re interested in.  
2. **Understand the Solution**: Open the file to explore the code and comments explaining the approach.  
3. **Run the Code**: You can test the solutions by running them in a Python environment.  

> **Note**: The solutions are designed to pass all test cases on Beecrowd but may not always be the most optimal implementation.  

## 🎯 Goals  

- Strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking.  
- Master Python for competitive programming scenarios.  
- Build a library of reference solutions for future challenges.
