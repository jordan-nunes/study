# 🏆 Codeforces

This directory contains my solutions to various competitive programming problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). The challenges are solved using Python, focusing on efficient algorithms and clean code.  

## 🗂️ Structure  

The exercises are organized by contest ID and problem ID, making it easy to navigate and locate solutions.  

### Example Structure  

```plaintext  
codeforces_exercises/  
│  
├── Contest_1234/  
│   ├── A.py  # Solution to problem A of contest 1234  
│   ├── B.py  # Solution to problem B of contest 1234  
│   └── ...  
│  
├── Problem_5678/  
│   ├── A.py  # Solution to problem A of contest 5678  
│   ├── C.py  # Solution to problem C of contest 5678  
│   └── ...  
│  
└── ...  
```  

## 📄 Contents  

- **Contests**: Each folder is named after the contest ID, containing solutions for all problems attempted in that contest.  
- **Problem Files**: Each file is named after the problem letter (e.g., `A.py`, `B.py`) corresponding to its identifier in the contest.  

## 🚀 How to Use  

1. **Locate the Contest**: Find the folder matching the contest ID.  
2. **Find the Problem**: Open the file corresponding to the problem ID (e.g., `A.py` for problem A).  
3. **Understand the Solution**: Review the code and comments for insight into the problem-solving approach.  
4. **Run the Code**: Test the solutions in a Python environment using the problem's input format.  

> **Note**: Problem statements are not included in this directory. Refer to [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) for full descriptions of each challenge.  

## 🎯 Goals  

- Enhance competitive programming skills.  
- Develop efficient solutions under time constraints.  
- Create a reusable library of solutions for future contests.
