# 🧑‍💻 Programming Study Repository

Welcome to my personal programming study repository! This space is dedicated to storing and tracking all my exercises, projects, and learning material as I continue my journey in coding and development. This collection includes everything from beginner projects to more advanced implementations as I dive deeper into programming languages, algorithms, and software development concepts.

## 📚 Contents

Here’s a snapshot of what you’ll find in this repo:

1. **Exercises**: Hands-on coding exercises focused on key concepts, including:
   - Basic syntax and language fundamentals
   - Data structures & algorithms
   - Object-oriented programming (OOP)
   - Functional programming, when applicable

2. **Projects**: Mini-projects to reinforce learning through real-world scenarios. Current and planned projects include:
   - Data analysis tasks
   - Web development
   - Algorithmic challenges and problem-solving
   - Any creative ideas that come to mind during the learning journey

3. **Tools and Libraries**: Experimentation with popular tools and libraries in programming, which will vary depending on the current focus of study.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

As I progress, I’m exploring and practicing with a mix of languages and frameworks, which includes:
- **Python** (main language for exercises and projects)
- **JavaScript/HTML5/CSS**

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a comprehensive portfolio of programming exercises and projects
- Develop mastery in core programming concepts
- Create a reference of solutions and approaches for future projects

## 🚀 Getting Started

Feel free to browse around! Each project and exercise includes its own README for clarity on purpose and usage.
