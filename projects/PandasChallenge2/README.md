# 📊 Mini Export Data Analysis Challenge  

This project is a data analysis challenge focused on Brazil’s exportation data from 2016 to 2020. Using Python and **Pandas**, I aim to answer specific questions about Brazil's exportations to France during this period. The project is designed to put into practice data manipulation and analysis skills.

> **Note**: The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size. It can be downloaded from Kaggle, link below.  

## 📄 Dataset  

- **Source**: The dataset is a Brazil Exportation Data Sheet, available on Kaggle.  
- **Scope**: Covers export data from 2016 to 2020.  
- **Focus**: The analysis narrows down the data to exportations from Brazil to France.  

## 🎯 Challenge Goals  

The primary objective of this challenge is to answer the following questions using the dataset:  
1. What are the main product categories exported to France?  
2. What is the total export value each year from 2016 to 2020?  
3. Which year saw the highest export value?  
4. Are there any noticeable trends in exportation volume or value?  

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries  

- **Python**: The main programming language used for this analysis.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration and visualization.  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.  

## 🚀 How to Run  

1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugovallejo/brazil-exports) and place it in the appropriate path referenced in the `analysis.ipynb` file.  
2. Open the `analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.  
3. Run the cells to see the data analysis process and answers to the challenge questions.  

## 📈 Outcomes  

The notebook provides insights into Brazil’s export patterns to France, with visualizations and data summaries to illustrate trends and key findings.
